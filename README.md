# Roulette 2019

## A school project in which we created a casino roulette in Javascript

- Should ask user to set his balance
- Input from user can only start the game if it's a number
- Should show the game table with the balance
- Ability to spin the roulette
- A number is chosen
- Ability to put chips on numbers, odd/even, black/red
- Chosen number is compared with numbers/colors/odd-evens with chips on them
- If number is correct, bet placed on it is multiplied by 35
- If color or odd/even is correct, bet is doubled
- Balance should always show the real-time balance
- Current bets are displayed
- Past bet for the game are displayed (reset upon loss)
- Little easter egg for teacher :P
